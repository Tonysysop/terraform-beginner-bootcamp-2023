        2. Peel off the beans with your hands (the hard way) or use a blender and pulse a couple of times to split the beans (the easy way) <br> <br>
        3. Blend the peeled beans with peppers, crayfish, salt, and bouillon powder (or cube). <br> <br>

        6. Stir in the diced onions.<br> <br>
